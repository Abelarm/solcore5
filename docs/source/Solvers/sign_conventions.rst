Current-voltage sign conventions
================================

In order to maintain internal consistency, the following sign conventions are used for current and voltage:

- A positive voltage means that a higher potential is applied to the front contact of the cell.
  For a p-n junction (i.e. p-type material is on top of n-type material), this means that a positive
  voltage results in 'solar cell operation' under illumination, with a positive Voc.
  For an n-p junction, a negative voltage must be applied and Voc will be negative.
