:literal:`Solcore` was born as a modular set of tools, written (almost) entirely in Python 3, to address some of the task we had to solve more often, such as fitting dark IV curves or luminescence decays. With time, however,  it has evolved as a complete semiconductor solver able of modelling the optical and electrical properties of a wide range of solar cells, from quantum well devices to multi-junction solar cells. Some of the features of Solcore are:
